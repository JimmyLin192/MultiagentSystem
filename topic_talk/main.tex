\frame{
    \frametitle{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most of works so far has focused exclusively on single agents
            we can extend reinforcement learning straightforwardly to multiple
            agents if they are all independent. 
        \item Intuitive idea: Multiple agents together will outperform
            any single agent due to the fact that they have more resources and
            a better chance of receiving rewards.
        \item Today, we will touch a really broad area 
            $$ \text{"Multiagent System" (M.A.S.).}
            $$

    \frametitle{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is multiple agent system?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Unfortunately, it is not formally defined by M.A.S. community.
                \item Employment of multiple agents (10 to thousands). 
                \item Intelligent mechanisms to address interactions between
                    agents.
            \end{itemize}
        \item When is it proposed?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item a relatively new sub-field of computer science 
                \item has only been studied since about 1980
                \item only gained widespread recognition since
                    about the mid-1990s
            \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Independent v.s. Cooperative Agents}
    Using independent agents as a benchmark, Tang Ming (1993) \cite{1} studied
    the performance of cooperative agents and concluded that: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Additional sensation from another agent is beneficial if it can
            be used efficiently
        \item Sharing learned policies or episodes among agents speeds up
            learning at the cost of communication
        \item For joint tasks, agents engaging in partnership can
            significantly outperform independent agents although they may
            learn slowly in the beginning.
    \end{itemize}
}
\frame{
    \frametitle{M.A.S. Environments}
    The agents in a multi-agent system have several important characteristics:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Autonomy: the agents are at least partially independent, self-aware, autonomous.
        \item Local views: no agent has a full global view of the system, or
            the system is too complex for an agent to make practical use of
            such knowledge.
        \item Decentralization: there is no designated controlling agent (or
            the system is effectively reduced to a monolithic system).
    \end{itemize}
}

    \frametitle{Active Research Areas}
    List of Multiagent Behaviors:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item communication
        \item cooperation and coordination
        \item negotiation
        \item distributed problem solving
        \item multi-agent learning
        \item fault-tolerance
    \end{itemize}
