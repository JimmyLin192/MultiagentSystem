    \frametitle{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is multiple agent system?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Unfortunately, it is not formally defined by M.A.S. community.
                \item Employment of multiple agents (10 to thousands). 
                \item Intelligent mechanisms to address interactions between
                    agents.
            \end{itemize}
        \item When is it proposed?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item a relatively new sub-field of computer science 
                \item only been studied since about 1980
                \item the field has only gained widespread recognition since
                    about the mid-1990s
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Characteristics of M.A.S. Environments}
    The agents in a multi-agent system have several important characteristics:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Autonomy: the agents are at least partially independent, self-aware, autonomous.
        \item Local views: no agent has a full global view of the system, or
            the system is too complex for an agent to make practical use of
            such knowledge
        \item Decentralization: there is no designated controlling agent (or the system is effectively reduced to a monolithic system)
    \end{itemize}
}
\frame{
    \frametitle{List of Multiagent Behaviors}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item communication
        \item cooperation and coordination
        \item negotiation
        \item distributed problem solving
        \item multi-agent learning
        \item fault-tolerance
    \end{itemize}
