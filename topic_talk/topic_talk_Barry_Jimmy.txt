For our topic talk, we propose to explore neural network architectures for multi-agent learning. Settings for this topic may include areas such as games, team-based simulations, multi agent robotics and control systems. We will cover techniques for a single network to control multiple agents, as well as the use of indepenendent cooperative networks. A number of the papers we are looking at use neuroevolution as the learning mechanism, but our talk will most likely include other methods in less detail. Also covered will be the role of communication, competition, and the use of homogeneus vs heterogenious behaviors for agents.
