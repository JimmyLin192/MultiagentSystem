Risto's Suggestion
-------------

We can create an effective team of e.g. Roombas to vacuum a floor by simply
cloning individual good behavior. But can we do better by evolving specialist?
Or by evolving special coordination mechanisms?

      There's a description of the Roomba mod in opennero.googlecode.com.
      We'll be using OpenNERO for the third homework so you'll be able to
      check it out pretty easily. There are many papers on the coordination of
      multiple agents, even on our website nn.cs.utexas.edu
      (e.g. http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?miikkulainen:wcci12, but also
      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?yong:ieeetamd10,
      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?cooperation, http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?armsrace,
      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?bryant:cec03,
      and a couple of UG thesis: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?chrisbush and
      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?johnston:ugthesis10). But you can easily find
      more by search multiagent coordination and neuroevolution in google.
